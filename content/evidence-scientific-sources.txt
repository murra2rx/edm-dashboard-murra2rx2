# Scientific Evidence: Research Findings

**Research Question:** Does inconsistent manager performance guidance lead to low feedback frequency and employee clarity deficits in remote/hybrid
 work?

**Total Studies:** 3 peer-reviewed studies (2 quantitative, 1 systematic review)  
**Date Range:** 2020-2025 (5 years of post-pandemic research)  
**Quality Level:** All published in peer-reviewed journals; 2 with quantitative effect sizes, 1 comprehensive systematic review  
**Hypothesis Tested:** X→M→Y (Inconsistent manager guidance → Low feedback frequency → Employee clarity deficits/performance decline)

**KEY EVIDENCE GAP:** None of the three studies directly measure feedback frequency as the mediator (M variable in X→M→Y model). Studies 1-2 test
 X→Y direct effects or alternative mediators (digital workplace, goal clarity).

## Study 1: Management Support and Employee Performance in Digital Workplace (Grzesiak & Ulrych, 2025)

**Citation:** Grzesiak, M., & Ulrych, N. (2025). Management support and employee performance in digital workplace. *Central European Management
 Journal*, 33(1), 79-98. https://doi.org/10.1108/CEMJ-06-2023-0238

**Study Design:** Cross-sectional quantitative study with structural equation modeling  
**Sample:** n = 1,000 remote/hybrid workers, digital workplace context  
**Key Variables:** Management support (feedback, goal-setting, coaching), digital workplace quality, employee performance

**Key Findings:**

**Correlation coefficients (all p < .01):**
- Management Support ↔ Employee Performance: r = .649
  * *Translation: Strong positive relationship; about 42% of performance variation explained by management support (r² = .42)*
- Digital Workplace ↔ Employee Performance: r = .657
  * *Translation: Strong positive relationship; good technology/tools predict better performance*
- Management Support ↔ Digital Workplace: r = .648
  * *Translation: When managers provide consistent support, employees use digital tools more effectively*

**Effect Sizes (Path Coefficients):**
- MS → DW: β = 0.762, p < .001 (strong effect)
  * *Translation: For every 1-unit increase in management support, digital workplace effectiveness increases by 0.76 units. This is a STRONG effect.*
- DW → EP: β = 0.575, p < .001 (medium-strong effect)
  * *Translation: Better digital workplace quality leads to 0.58-unit increase in employee performance. Medium-strong effect.*
- MS → EP (direct): β = 0.275, p < .001 (small-medium effect)
  * *Translation: Even without technology, management support directly improves performance by 0.28 units. Smaller but still significant.*
- Partial mediation confirmed: Digital workplace quality mediates relationship between management support and employee performance
  * *Translation: Management support works TWO ways - directly improves performance AND indirectly by helping employees use technology better*
- Multiple correlations all in moderate-to-strong range (r = .64-.66)
  * *Translation: These are robust, meaningful relationships - not weak or trivial effects*

**Conclusion:** Management support practices (feedback, goal-setting, coaching) significantly predict employee performance in remote/hybrid work,
 both directly and indirectly through digital workplace quality.

**Relevance:** Recent data (2025); large sample; establishes X→M→Y relationship using digital workplace as mediator; directly supports importance
 of consistent management practices in remote contexts

## Study 2: Performance Feedback, Goal Clarity, and Public Employees' Performance (Park & Choi, 2020)

**Citation:** Park, S., & Choi, W. (2020). Performance feedback, goal clarity, and public employees' performance. *Sustainability*, 12(7), 
3011. https://doi.org/10.3390/su12073011

**Study Design:** Cross-sectional structural equation modeling with moderation analysis  
**Sample:** n = 2,630 public sector employees  
**Key Variables:** Performance feedback frequency/quality, performance goal clarity, individual performance ratings, autonomy (moderator)

**Key Findings:**

**Correlation coefficients (all p < .001):**
- Performance Feedback ↔ Performance Goal Clarity: r = .165
  * *Translation: Modest positive relationship; about 3% of goal clarity variation explained by feedback. Weaker than Study 1 but still 
  statistically significant.*
- Performance Goal Clarity ↔ Individual Performance: r = .136
  * *Translation: Small-moderate relationship; clearer goals associated with better performance, explaining about 2% of variation.*
- Performance Feedback ↔ Individual Performance: r = .037 (direct effect)
  * *Translation: Very weak direct effect; feedback alone barely improves performance (<1% variance explained). KEY INSIGHT: Feedback needs
   to create clarity first!*

**Effect Sizes (Path Coefficients):**
- Feedback → Goal Clarity: β = 0.165, p < .001
  * *Translation: More feedback increases goal clarity by 0.17 units. Small but significant effect.*
- Goal Clarity → Performance: β = 0.136, p < .001
  * *Translation: For every 1-unit increase in goal clarity, performance increases by 0.14 units.*
- Indirect mediation effect: β = 0.022, p < .001 (significant mediation)
  * *Translation: This is the "hidden pathway" - feedback → clarity → performance. The chain reaction effect is statistically real even if 
  small in magnitude.*
- Model explained variance in performance: R² = .184
  * *Translation: This model explains 18% of why some employees perform better than others. There are other factors too, but clarity matters.*
- Autonomy positively moderated goal clarity→performance relationship
  * *Translation: Goal clarity works BETTER when employees have more autonomy/control over their work.*

**Conclusion:** Performance feedback significantly improves individual performance through the mediating role of performance goal clarity. 
Employees with clearer understanding of performance goals achieved higher performance ratings.

**Relevance:** Very large sample (n=2,630); objective performance ratings; establishes X→M→Y mediation using goal clarity as mediator (conceptually
 related to employee clarity); directly addresses role of feedback in reducing clarity deficits

## Study 3: What Makes Telework Work? Evidence of Success Factors Across Two Decades (Gohoungodji et al., 2023)

**Citation:** Gohoungodji, P., N'Dri, A. B., & Matos, A. L. B. (2023). What makes telework work? Evidence of success factors across two decades 
of empirical research: A systematic and critical review. *International Journal of Human Resource Management*, 34(3), 605-649.
 https://doi.org/10.1080/09585192.2022.2112259

**Study Design:** Systematic review with vote-counting analysis  
**Sample:** 83 empirical articles synthesized (2000-2021); 111 citations (high-impact)  
**Key Variables:** Telework success factors across 5 categories (technological materials, non-technological materials, teleworkers, work environment, 
family environment)

**Key Findings:**

**Comprehensive literature search across 4 major databases:**
- ABI/INFORM, Business Source Complete, PsycINFO, Scopus
- Transparent inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Vote-counting methodology to identify dominant patterns

**7 factors with dominant overall positive effects on telework success:**
1. Media richness (technology quality)
2. Experience (teleworker familiarity)
3. **Communication** (frequency and quality)
   * *Translation: When managers communicate frequently and clearly, telework succeeds. Infrequent/inconsistent communication = telework failure.*
4. Work-family facilitation
5. **Supervisor support** (including feedback and guidance)
   * *Translation: This is YOUR X variable! Inconsistent manager guidance undermines this critical success factor.*
6. Top management support
7. **Trust** (between employee and supervisor)
   * *Translation: Inconsistent guidance destroys trust. When managers are unpredictable, employees can't trust them.*

**Effect Sizes:**
- NOT a meta-analysis: qualitative synthesis without aggregate effect sizes
  * *Translation: No single "r = .XX" number because this combines different study designs. Instead, uses vote-counting.*
- Vote-counting analysis shows strong empirical consensus across 83 studies
  * *Translation: If 83 different studies, across 21 years, in different countries all agree - that's VERY strong evidence, even without a
   meta-analytic effect size.*
- Supervisor support, communication frequency, and trust consistently associated with positive telework outcomes
  * *Translation: These THREE factors kept appearing as important across decades - this is robust, replicated evidence.*

**Conclusion:** Strong empirical consensus across two decades of research confirms supervisor support, communication frequency, and trust as critical
 success factors for telework performance.

**Relevance:** Comprehensive scope (83 studies over 21 years); establishes robust evidence base for supervisor support and communication as dominant 
factors; directly supports X→M→Y framework where inconsistent manager guidance (low supervisor support/communication) negatively impacts 
employee performance

## SYNTHESIS ACROSS ALL THREE STUDIES

### Convergent Evidence (Agreement)

**1. Manager support/feedback associated with better performance:**
- **Study 1:** r = .649 (LARGE effect) - Management support ↔ Performance
- **Study 2:** r = .136 (small-medium effect) - Goal clarity ↔ Performance  
- **Study 3:** Supervisor support identified as 1 of 7 dominant success factors across 83 studies
- **All show positive relationship between consistent manager guidance and employee performance**

**2. Mediation pathways exist:**
- **Study 1:** Partial mediation through digital workplace (β = 0.575, p < .001)
- **Study 2:** Mediation through goal clarity (β = 0.022, p < .001)
- **Study 3:** Communication frequency consistently associated with telework success
- **Consensus: Manager support doesn't just directly help - it works through intermediary mechanisms**

**3. Clarity/communication is critical:**
- **Study 1:** Management support → Digital workplace effectiveness (r = .648)
- **Study 2:** Feedback → Goal clarity (β = 0.165); Goal clarity → Performance (β = 0.136)
- **Study 3:** Communication (frequency/quality) and supervisor support both in top 7 factors
- **Pattern: Employees need clear, consistent communication to perform well remotely**

### Divergent Evidence (Disagreement)

**Strength of relationships varies:**
- **Study 1** shows MUCH stronger effects (r = .64-.66) than **Study 2** (r = .04-.17)
- **Possible reasons:** 
  * Study 1 broader "management support" construct vs Study 2 narrow "feedback frequency"
  * Study 1 private sector vs Study 2 public sector (more bureaucracy)
  * Digital workplace context (Study 1) may amplify effects
  * Study 2 conservative estimates due to very large sample


### Evidence Gaps

❌ **NONE directly measure feedback frequency as mediator (M variable)**  
❌ **No X→M studies** (inconsistent guidance → low feedback frequency)  
❌ **No M→Y studies** (feedback frequency → clarity, controlling for guidance quality)  
❌ **All cross-sectional** (not longitudinal - can't prove causation)  
❌ **Study 3 qualitative synthesis** (no aggregate meta-analytic effect size)  
❌ **No studies measure your specific metrics** (1.8 vs 4-6 meetings/month; 3.4 vs 4.2 clarity scores)

## OVERALL EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT

**Question:** Does inconsistent manager performance guidance lead to low feedback frequency and employee clarity deficits in remote/hybrid work?

**Answer:** PARTIALLY SUPPORTED

**X→Y (Inconsistent guidance → Performance decline):**
- ✅ **Association established:** Studies 1-2 show correlations (r = .04 to .65)
- ⚠️ **Causation unclear:** Cross-sectional designs can't prove direction
- ✅ **Practically significant:** Large sample sizes, consistent patterns across contexts

**X→M→Y (Full mediation model):**
- ⚠️ **Indirect evidence only:** Studies measure alternative mediators (digital workplace, goal clarity) not feedback frequency itself
- ❌ **Cannot test your specific mediation:** Feedback frequency as M variable unmeasured
- ✅ **Conceptual support:** Goal clarity (Study 2) is conceptually related to your "employee clarity deficits"

**Confidence Level:** MODERATE-HIGH
- **Strong correlational evidence** (X↔Y)
- **Moderate causal evidence** (X→Y unclear due to cross-sectional designs)
- **Weak evidence for specific mediating pathway** (X→M→Y with feedback frequency as M)

### Key Insights:
- Manager support/feedback consistency associated with performance across multiple studies and 21 years of research
- Effect sizes range from small (r = .14) to large (r = .65) depending on context
- Remote/hybrid work contexts show stronger need for structured management practices
- Mediation pathways exist (through clarity, digital workplace, communication)
- Goal clarity is validated mediator conceptually similar to "employee clarity deficits"
- Public sector may experience weaker effects than private sector

### Need for Evidence Triangulation:
- ✅ **Practitioner evidence** (manager interviews) - feedback frequency mechanisms and barriers
- ✅ **Organizational evidence** (company data) - actual meeting frequencies, clarity scores
- ✅ **Stakeholder evidence** - employee perceptions, feasibility, cultural fit
