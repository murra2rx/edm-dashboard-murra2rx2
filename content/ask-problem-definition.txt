# Problem Definition Framework
Managers in remote and hybrid teams provide inconsistent performance guidance, negatively affecting employee 
clarity and performance.

## X → Y Framework
### Current State (X - What's happening now that's problematic?)
Managers in remote and hybrid teams provide inconsistent performance feedback resulting in:
- unclear expectations about job responsibilities
- uneven feedback quality across managers and teams 
- confusion among employees about how their performance is evaluated 
- decreased motivation and engagement due to lack of guidance 
- performance gaps that affect individual and team productivity 

### Desired State (Y - What outcome do we want to achieve?)
An organization with a clear, consistent performance management system where:
- remote and hybrid employees receive regular, high-quality, structured feedback
- expectations and evaluation criteria are transparent and easy to understand
- managers use standardized tools and practices to assess performance
- employees feel supported, motivated, and confident in meeting goals
- team and organizational performance improves through clarity and consistency


## PICOC Framework
### Population (P - Who is affected by this problem?)
- Remote and hybrid employees who rely on clear performance expectations
- Managers who are responsible for giving feedback and evaluating performance
- HR staff who monitor performance data and ensure fairness
- Leadership who depend on accurate performance information for decision-making



### Intervention (I - What solution/action are we considering?)
Performance management training and standardization, including:
- training managers to give clear, consistent, structured feedback
- standardized performance criteria, tools, and evaluation forms 
- scheduled performance check-ins instead of irregular or annual-only reviews
- clear communication of expectations for remote and hybrid teams 



### Comparison (C - What alternatives exist?)
- leave performance evaluations fully up to each manager's individual style
- use automated software without proper training
- rely solely on annual performance reviews instead of ongoing feedback



### Outcomes (O - What will success look like?)
- 20% increase in employee clarity about performance expectations
- 25% improvement in satisfaction with feedback quality
- more consistent evaluation scores across teams (reduced variation)
- increased employee motivation and engagement
- improved productivity and goal achievement for remote/hybrid teams



### Context (C - Where/when does this apply?)
- this applies to remote and hybrid teams across the organization during the current performance cycle (6-12 months)
- it is relevant in distributed work environments where communication and evaluation practices vary widely across managers

## Clear Problem Statement
Managers in remote and hybrid teams provide inconsistent performance guidance, negatively affecting employee 
clarity and performance.

## Why This Problem Matters
### Impact on Organization
- Reduced productivity due to unclear performance expectations
- Lower employee engagement and motivation
- Inaccurate performance data for decision-making
- Difficulty identifying skill gaps and development needs
- Higher turnover risk among frustrated or unsupported employees


### Stakeholder Impact
- Employees: unclear expectations, inconsistent evaluations, decreased growth opportunities
- Managers: increased stress due to unclear processes and inconsistent tools
- HR: difficulty ensuring fairness and tracking performance trends
- Leadership: limited visibility into true performance and organizational capability

### Strategic Alignment
This problem directly impacts organizational goals related to:
- Employee development and engagement
- Leadership effectiveness
- Talent retention
- Organizational performance and productivity
- Building a strong, consistent remote work culture


## Evidence Questions to Explore
### For the Problem (Step 2)
- What evidence shows inconsistent feedback for remote workers?
- How common is unclear performance guidance across teams?
- What root causes lead to inconsistent performance management (e.g., training gaps, unclear standards, limited tools)?


### For the Solution (Step 4)
- What evidence shows that performance management training improves clarity and fairness?
- Have similar organizations seen benefits from standardized evaluation systems?
- What risks, resource needs, or barriers could impact implementation?
