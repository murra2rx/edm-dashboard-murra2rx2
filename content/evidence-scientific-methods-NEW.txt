# Scientific Evidence: Methods & Acquisition Strategy

## Research Question
Does inconsistent manager performance guidance lead to 
low feedback frequency and employee clarity deficits 
in remote/hybrid work?

## X→M→Y Hypothesis Framework

**X (Independent Variable):** 
Inconsistent manager performance guidance / 
lack of standardization

**M (Mediator):** 
Low feedback frequency 
(1.8 vs 4-6 meetings/month best practice)

**Y (Dependent Variable):** 
Employee clarity deficits 
(3.4 vs 4.2 benchmark) / performance

**Date of Search:** November 2025

### Databases Searched
- Google Scholar - Multidisciplinary academic search
- Business Source Premier (EBSCO) - Business research
- PsycINFO - Psychology/organizational behavior

### Boolean Search Queries

**Query 1 (X→Y Direct Effect):**
```
("performance management" OR "manager guidance" OR 
 "leadership consistency") AND 
("role clarity" OR "employee clarity" OR "performance") AND 
("remote work" OR "hybrid work" OR "telework")
```

**Query 2 (X→M Feedback Frequency):**
```
("performance management" OR "manager training" OR 
 "standardized feedback") AND 
("feedback frequency" OR "one-on-one" OR "check-in") AND 
("remote" OR "hybrid" OR "virtual")
```

**Query 3 (Meta-analyses/Reviews):**
```
("systematic review" OR "meta-analysis") AND 
("performance management" OR "feedback" OR "leadership") AND 
("remote work" OR "telework")
```

## CONFIRMED STUDIES (n = 3)

### Study 1: Management support and employee performance 
in digital workplace
(Grzesiak & Ulrych, 2025)

- **Journal:** Central European Management Journal
- **DOI:** 10.1108/CEMJ-06-2023-0238
- **Design:** Cross-sectional quantitative study
- **Sample:** n = 1,000 remote/hybrid workers
- **Effect Sizes (Pearson Correlations, p < .01):**
  * Management Support ↔ Employee Performance: 
    r = .649**
  * Digital Workplace ↔ Employee Performance: 
    r = .657**
  * Management Support ↔ Digital Workplace: 
    r = .648**
- **Path Coefficients (Standardized):**
  * MS → DW: β = 0.762, p < .001
  * DW → EP: β = 0.575, p < .001
  * MS → EP (direct): β = 0.275, p < .001
 
- **Key Finding:** Management support practices 
  (feedback, goal-setting, coaching) significantly 
  predict employee performance in remote/hybrid work, 
  both directly (r = .649) and indirectly through 
  digital workplace quality (partial mediation). 

- **Relevance:** HIGH - Large sample establishes 
  X→M→Y relationship (management support → digital 
  workplace effectiveness → employee performance). 
  Multiple correlation coefficients all in 
  moderate-to-strong range (r = .64-.66).
