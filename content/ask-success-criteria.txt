# Success Criteria Definition
# Define specific, measurable criteria to evaluate solution effectiveness

## SMART Success Criteria

### Criterion 1: Employee Clarity About Performance Expectations
- **Specific:** Percentage of remote and hybrid employees who report clear understanding of their performance expectations
and evaluation criteria
- **Measurable:** Employee survey results showing agreement with statement "I clearly understand what is expected of me and
how my performance is evaluated" (5-point scale)
- **Achievable:** Target a 20% increase from baseline (e.g., from 55% to 75% agreement) within 6 months using standardized
tools and training
- **Relevant:** Directly addresses the core problem of inconsistent performance guidance causing employee confusion
- **Time-bound:** Baseline measurement at start, check-in at 3 months, full assessment at 6 months

### Criterion 2: Consistency in Feedback Quality Across Teams
- **Specific:** Reduction in variation of feedback quality scores across different managers and teams, measured by standard 
deviation of employee satisfaction ratings
- **Measurable:** Employee feedback satisfaction survey scores (5-point scale) showing reduced standard deviation across teams
by 25%
- **Achievable:** With manager training and standardized evaluation forms, variation can decrease from high inconsistency to 
moderate consistency within 6 months
- **Relevant:** Addresses the uneven feedback quality that is central to the problem
- **Time-bound:** Compare baseline variation to 6-month follow-up measurement

### Criterion 3: Manager Confidence in Giving Structured Feedback
- **Specific:** Percentage of managers who report confidence in their ability to provide clear, consistent, structured
feedback to remote employees
- **Measurable:** Manager survey results showing agreement with "I feel confident using standardized tools to evaluate and provide
feedback" (5-point scale)
- **Achievable:** Target 30% increase in manager confidence (e.g., from 60% to 90% agreement) within 3-6 months after training completion
- **Relevant:** Directly supports solution effectiveness and addresses the root cause of inconsistent guidance
- **Time-bound:** Pre-training baseline, post-training assessment at 1 month, follow-up at 6 months

## Measurement Framework

### Quantitative Metrics

- **Employee clarity score:** 20% increase (from 55% to 75% who "clearly understand expectations")
- **Feedback satisfaction:** 25% improvement in average satisfaction rating (from 3.2 to 4.0 on 5-point scale)
- **Feedback consistency:** 25% reduction in standard deviation of scores across teams
- **Manager confidence:** 30% increase in managers reporting confidence (from 60% to 90%)
- **Evaluation completion rate:** 95% of scheduled performance check-ins completed on time
- **Employee engagement:** 15% increase in engagement survey scores related to development and clarity

### Qualitative Indicators

## Stakeholder-Specific Success Criteria

### Management Success Measures
- More reliable performance data for strategic decisions
- Reduced performance-related disputes and HR complaints
- Improved team productivity and goal achievement
- Higher retention rates among high performers
