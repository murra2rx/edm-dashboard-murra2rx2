**Quality Hierarchy Recommendation:**
1. **Focus first on Meta-analyses & Systematic Reviews** (highest quality)
2. **Then examine Controlled & Longitudinal Studies** (high quality)
3. **Finally review General Studies** (evaluate quality individually)

### Next Steps
1. Use final queries to identify 5 studies or effect sizes
2. Include meta-analyses where available
3. Apply additional filters as needed
4. Document findings in evidence-scientific-sources.txt
